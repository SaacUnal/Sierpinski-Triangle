# Multiverse of DataStructures
For this proyect the objective is to make a unique and original type of data structure. 
This is going to be called a multiverse, the idea is to make posible to travel betwen universes following a set of rules.

# Rules
1. A universe have a maximum of 6 direct conections with other universes.
2. Theres no way back when traveling. So the conections are unilateral.
3. The multiverse have a minimum of 36 universes.
4. These universes can be created and destroyed.

# Sierpinski Triangle
We propose a data structure that reasembles a Sierpinski triangle.
This data structure consists in triangles that are conected betwen their vertices and levels that are conected by 1 vertex of the triangle after the 3 level:
(0 have 3 conections, 1 have 3 conections, 2 have 2 conections and after 3 it has 1 conection except the corner triangles).
After the level 0, each level have 3^n universes maximum.

This is how the basic triangle works:

And this is how a compound triangle works:
